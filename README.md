This is our ZX Spectrum project in which we are writing a game in z80 assembly.

There are several files with routines which we are writing right now. These files end in .s and
might have an example in them to try out.

To compile a file named file.s and run it in FUSE:
```
make file 
```

Make sure to not include the .s
