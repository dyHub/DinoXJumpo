This week we got the interface for the update list to work pretty well. Now you can draw
graphics pretty easily with this interface. 

We have an example going that can make our 2x2 char cell trex jump. We are listening for I/O
on the keyboard and when we see that the space is pressed, we remove the old trex, put a new 
trex where it should jump, halt for a couple cycles, then remove the trex at it's jumped position
to reset the state of everything.

You can try it by running make main
